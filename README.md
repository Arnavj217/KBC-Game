The KBC Game is a C++ console-based project inspired by the famous quiz show "Kaun Banega Crorepati". The game allows a user to participate in a quiz competition where they must answer multiple-choice questions to win virtual prize money.
The main purpose of this project is to understand the use of basic C++ programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and arrays, and to develop an interactive command-line application.
